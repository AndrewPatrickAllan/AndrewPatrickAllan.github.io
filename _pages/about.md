I am an astrophysics PhD researcher at the Leiden University, advised by <a href ="https://avidotto.github.io/"> Aline Vidotto.</a> My research focuses on modelling the hydrodynamic escape of highly irradiated exoplanetary atmospheres, and how this varies over the lifetime of the planet. </p> 

<p align="justify"> I am currently interested in modelling a signature of this atmospheric escape which can be observed during planetary transit, the helium 2^3S triplet at 1083nm. The main benefit of this spectral feature is that it is observable with <i>ground</i> based telescopes such as <a href="https://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/SPIRou/"> SPIRou </a> in Hawaii and <a href="https://carmenes.caha.es/ext/instrument/index.html"> CARMENES </a> in Spain rather than the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/"> Hubble Space Telescope </a> as required by the hydrogen Lya line. To study how this observable signature depends on the atmospheric escape, we developed a one dimensional model which self consistently solves the equations of hydrodynamic escape while calculating the population of helium in the required 2^3S state <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/527/3/4657/7379618"> (Allan et al. 2024).  </a>  </p>

<p align="justify">  In 2021, I obtained a Masters by Research from Trinity College Dublin, using radiative transfer modelling to predict the spectral features of type Ibn supernovae and eruptive massive stars.  In 2019, I graduated from the Physics and Astrophysics undergraduate course at Trinity College Dublin. </p>
